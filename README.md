# aether-connector-okhttp
A repository connector implementation based on Square's OkHttp.

**ARCHIVED PROJECT**, without any active development.

This connector is implemented against older Aether (today Maven Resolver) and does not and cannot support latest features like parallel deploy, extensible checksum alrgorithm implementations and so on. Moreover, the new plans for Maven Resolver 1.10.0 include HTTP/2 transports like this one, but also feature improvements like checksum extraction from headers and many more.
